# Upskill

Run a retrospective on this session (`session-digest` with no argument reads it), or on the one the user names (`session-digest SESSION` reads a past one, such as the session before a `/clear`; a subagent's output-file path holds a different session's id): find what cost time or tokens, and pitch changes that make the next session cheaper.

Also look for important conventions in the repositories that might be ill-formed.

## 1. Mine the history

Walk the whole transcript, first turn to last. Your context holds only a subagent's final report, so read its work in `session-digest`'s output: each subagent's tool calls, errors and retries, and what every agent and tool cost. Collect every instance of:

- **Mistakes**: wrong assumptions, retracted answers, reverted edits, user corrections.
- **Waste**: dead ends, oversized reads or outputs, searches that took several tries to land.
- **Repetition**: the same command sequence, lookup or explanation done more than once.
- **Missing context**: anything you learned by trial, by asking the user, or by digging through code, that a doc could have told you. That includes hidden dependencies: files that must change together with nothing pointing from one to the other.
- **Hungry tools**: a CLI, MCP server or script of ours whose output costs more tokens than the agent used. `session-digest`'s biggest outputs are the place to start.

Done when every failed tool call and hook error, in the main session and in each subagent, and every user correction is accounted for, either as a finding or dismissed with a reason.

## 2. Match each finding to a fix

In rough descending order of preference, look for these:

- **Deterministic task**: automate it. Research existing libraries and tools first. Prefer, in order: one that solves it out of the box; a thin layer around one; an extension of a binary or script the project already has; a new Python script in the project's `bin/`.
- **Repeated task needing judgment**: a project-local skill (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), written with `writing-for-agents`.
- **Missing context**: docs. If the context was written but you missed it, sharpen the pointer to it. If a doc was wrong, fix it. If nothing was written, add a doc. `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` load into every session, so they hold pointers, not the material itself.
- **Hungry tool**: trim its default output, or add a flag for the short form.
- **Mistake from a habit**: in decreasing preference: strengthen the description of an untriggered skill that would have helped, update a skill that was used, create a new skill. These changes should target the mistaken habit.
- **Duplicated skill or tool**: when the skill or tool a fix changes also has a copy elsewhere (a project's `.claude/skills/` or `bin/` copying one from `llm-toolbox`, or the reverse), make the change in every copy it applies to. A change that only fits one place, such as a project-specific rule, stays in that copy.

The most promising solutions will automate deterministic tasks. If even a part of a finding can be fixed with a mechanistic solution, propose it.

Drop one-offs with no cheaper path next time.

## 3. Conventions

Look for candidates for improvement in these categories.

- **Automated checks**: are there automated checks that could catch errors the agent made? Linting, typing, tests, filesystem linters? Read the repo's own check command first (its `package.json`/build-tool `lint`/`check` scripts, its CI workflow), so a check that already exists but sits unwired or silently broken is the finding, not a reinvention. A repo with no **guardrail** (no pre-commit hook and no CI job running its lint/typecheck/test command) is itself a finding: an un-linted repo is a standing missed opportunity, not a neutral default. _Use when_ the agent made a mistake an automated check could have caught, or the repo has no guardrail at all.
- **Coding standards**: should the **reviewer agent** be given a new rule to enforce? Should an existing rule be removed or clarified? Classify the violation first: a **mechanical** one (a fixed syntactic pattern, a banned API, an import shape, a file-location rule) gets a deterministic check, full stop: a custom rule in the repo's own linter, a new pre-commit hook, or a new CI job, whichever the repo's language and existing guardrail make cheapest. Default to building the check over writing the rule. Reserve `CODING_STANDARDS.md` (or `~/.agents/skills/coding/standards.md` for a rule that holds across repos) for genuine **judgement calls** (cross-file consistency, "matches the surrounding style," anything no guardrail could ever substitute for). _Use when_ the reviewer agent failed to catch a mistake.
- **Global AGENTS.md**: are there any steering instructions that should be moved to coding standards (or automated checks) instead? _Use when_ the AGENTS.md file is particularly large - in the repo OR the user's global scope.
- **No-ops**: look for instructions in steering files that don't modify the agent's behavior. _Use when_ the steering files are large and unwieldy.
- **Information access**: look for opportunities to increase the agent's access to information. Teeing dev server logs, readonly access to third-party services. _Use when_ a crucial piece of information was not available to the agent.


## 4. Pitch

Make no changes yet. Present a numbered list, biggest payoff first. Each item: the finding with its evidence from the transcript, the proposed fix, and its size. Ask questions wherever you're unsure. Then stop: the user picks which ones to follow through on now.
