"""The ledger: every number, table, figure and text the paper cites, under its key, with where it came from.

The data sources in paper/data/ fill it; the build writes it to paper/build/numbers.json, which paper/lib.typ
reads, so no number in the paper is typed by hand. Keys lead with the experiment id (`cpl7.opus.n3.cartel`).

A rate with an interval is one cell's: replies to one model and one prompt (so one condition and market size),
each an independent draw. A count over several cells, such as three models pooled, is `pooled` and has no
interval: its replies come from different distributions.

Each entry is a JSON object with its `kind` (rate, pooled, value, table, figure or text), its fields, `how` it
was computed in a few words, and, once merged into the paper's ledger, its `source`: the data source's module
and function and the log files it read."""
